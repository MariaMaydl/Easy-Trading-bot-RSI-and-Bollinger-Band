# Trading Bot 

This is a simplified Version of a trading bot, which follows the idea of mean reversion. It is a trading strategy that is based on the assumption that the price will tend to move back towards it average price. 

--> Conclusion: You buy an asset when its price is lower than its mean and sell when its higher. Traders with this strategy search for strong price movements. 
I used indicators like RSI and Bollinger Bands.

**Some Drawbacks:**
* if the stock drops for a major reason (structural change, etc.) the chances that the stock will go back to its mean is smaller
* Strong price movements can go on for a longer time


**This is bot is very simplified and should definitely not be used for actual trading. It can definitely be improved by adding backtesting**

The main goal was to implement the rsi and bollinger bands from scratch and create a very simple bot.
